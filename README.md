# 🎵 Accessibility Copilot — Album Viewer

A simple web application with **intentional accessibility issues**, designed to demonstrate how **GitHub Copilot** can assess, identify, and remediate WCAG 2.2 violations through automated workflows.

The app is a Vue.js / TypeScript music store that looks perfectly functional visually but contains **21 WCAG 2.2 violations** — making it a hands-on playground for accessibility auditing and automated remediation with GitHub Copilot.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A GitHub account with access to [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

## Run the App Locally

```bash
cd SamplesAndTest/album-viewer
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app starts on `http://localhost:5173` by default (Vite dev server).

## Accessibility Instructions

The accessibility rules used by Copilot are defined in [`.github/instructions/a11y.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/a11y.instructions.md). These instructions are based on WCAG 2.2 AA standards and cover semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation, forms, color contrast, and framework-specific patterns.

> **Keeping instructions up to date:** The community-maintained source of truth is the [awesome-copilot accessibility instructions](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/instructions/a11y.instructions.md). Check there for the latest updates and contribute improvements.

## Demo Scenario

### Goal

Use GitHub Copilot to **automatically audit** a pull request for accessibility issues, **create tracking issues**, and **trigger automated remediation** via the Coding Agent.

### Steps

1. **Create the `run-a11y-review` label** in your fork — go to **Issues → Labels → New label**, name it exactly `run-a11y-review`, and save. This is the label the workflow listens for, so it must exist before you can apply it.

2. **Create a Pull Request** from the `feat/new-concerts-near-you-feature` branch (the only branch other than `main`) into `main`

3. **Add the `run-a11y-review` label** on the PR — this triggers the agentic workflow that performs the accessibility audit

4. **Watch the Copilot session** running in the GitHub Actions tab — the agent reviews the changed files against WCAG 2.2 criteria

5. **Check the issues created automatically** once the session ends (approximately 15–20 minutes) — each accessibility violation is filed as an individual issue with severity, WCAG reference, and recommended fix

6. **Assign an issue to the Coding Agent** from the issue panel to trigger an automatic remediation — Copilot will open a PR with the proposed fix

### What Gets Detected

The app contains 21 intentional violations across 4 areas:

| Area | Examples | Count |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Page setup** | Missing `lang`, no skip link, no landmarks, low contrast | 6 |
| **Album cards** | `<div>` instead of `<button>`, no `alt` text, positive `tabindex` | 6 |
| **Album preview modal** | No focus trap, no Escape key, flash animation, non-interactive play button | 4 |
| **Cart & checkout** | No labels on inputs, unlinked errors, enforced time limit, blinking animation | 5 |

> For a detailed before/after breakdown of every violation, see [`docs/a11y-audit-scenario.md`](docs/a11y-audit-scenario.md).

## Fork & Setup Guide

If you fork this repo, you need to configure a **GitHub App** and a **Copilot token** for the agentic workflows to run.

### 1. Create a GitHub App

1. Go to **Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**
2. Fill in the basics:
   - **Name**: e.g. `a11y-copilot-bot`
   - **Homepage URL**: your repo URL
   - **Webhook**: uncheck "Active" (not needed)
3. Set **repository permissions**:

   | Permission | Access | Why |
   |-----------|--------|-----|
   | **Contents** | Read | Read source files during audit |
   | **Issues** | Read & Write | Create issues for findings |
   | **Pull requests** | Read & Write | Post review comments on PRs |
   | **Discussions** | Read & Write | Required by the `safe-outputs` token minted by `gh-aw` |
   | **Metadata** | Read | Required by default |

   > **Why Discussions?** Even though this workflow only posts comments and creates issues, `gh-aw` mints the `safe-outputs` GitHub App token with `discussions: write`. If the App is missing this permission, every run fails with *"The permissions requested are not granted to this installation"* and a follow-up *"Input required and not supplied: github-token"* error. Granting **Discussions: Read & Write** resolves both.

4. Click **Create GitHub App**
5. Note the **App ID** displayed on the app's settings page
6. Scroll to **Private keys** → **Generate a private key** — a `.pem` file downloads

### 2. Install the GitHub App

1. From the app's settings page, click **Install App** in the left sidebar
2. Select your fork's account/org
3. Choose **Only select repositories** → pick your fork
4. Click **Install**

> **Already installed the App before adding a permission?** Permission changes are **not** applied automatically. Go to **Settings → GitHub Apps → Configure** your App and accept the prompt to grant the newly requested permissions (e.g. Discussions) for the repository. Until you accept, token minting keeps failing.

### 3. Configure Repository Secrets & Variables

Go to your fork: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

#### Variables (tab: Variables)

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `APP_ID` | The App ID from step 1 |

#### Secrets (tab: Secrets)

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | The full contents of the `.pem` file from step 1 |

These are referenced by the agentic workflows in `.github/workflows/a11y-pr-review.md` and `a11y-scheduled-audit.md`:
```yaml
github-app:
  app-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
  private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

### 4. Copilot as the AI Engine

The agentic workflows use **GitHub Copilot** as the default AI engine. This requires:

- **GitHub Copilot** enabled on your account/org (Business or Enterprise plan)
- The repository must have **GitHub Actions** enabled
- No additional secret is needed — Copilot authentication is handled automatically by the `gh-aw` runtime via the `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by Actions

> **Alternative AI engines**: If you want to use a different model, add the corresponding secret and update the workflow configuration:
>
> | Engine | Secret name | Docs |
> |--------|------------|------|
> | Anthropic (Claude) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | [gh-aw auth docs](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/auth/) |
> | OpenAI (Codex) | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | [gh-aw auth docs](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/auth/) |

### 5. Allow Network Access to w3.org

The agentic workflows run inside a network firewall that only permits a default
allowlist of domains. The audit reads WCAG references from **w3.org**, which is
**not** in the defaults — so you must whitelist it explicitly, otherwise fetches
to `https://www.w3.org/...` are blocked (and URLs may appear as `(redacted)` in
the output).

Add a top-level `network` block to each workflow `.md` file
(`.github/workflows/a11y-pr-review.md` and `a11y-scheduled-audit.md`):

```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults    # keep the built-in infrastructure allowlist
    - "w3.org"    # WCAG references (matches www.w3.org and all subdomains)
```

> A listed domain automatically matches all of its subdomains, so `w3.org`
> covers `www.w3.org`. After editing the `.md` files, recompile (see next step)
> so the change is written into the `.lock.yml` files.

### 6. Compile the Agentic Workflows

After forking and configuring secrets, compile the lock files:

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-aw
gh aw compile
```

The `.lock.yml` files are already committed in this repo. You only need to recompile if you modify the `.md` workflow files.
